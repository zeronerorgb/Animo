We create a unique product on the market of goods and services for domestic animals – Remote-controlled feeder with a method of healthy feeding developed together with veterinarians. The feeder allows you to control the time of issue of feed and its dosage according to individually developed diet. 


Russia is among the top five countries in the number of pets. 60% of the population have pets, of which 43% - cat. The Russian market of goods for the animals grows at 20-30% per year, 2 times faster than abroad. Its volume is estimated at about $ 2 billion. 


The survey showed that 87% of pet owners have complained that they can not control their pets meals. The lack of control leads to overeating. Liver lipidosis, diabetes, heart failure, metabolic diseases - are only a few consequences that may result in obesity. 


90% of cats living in large cities are sterilized. They need a special control of the nutrition as they are particularly susceptible to various diseases. The consequence of this: better control is needed for their diet. 


To solve these problems, we have developed a software and hardware system which includes a dispensing water (provided the circulation and purification of water through the multi-stage filters to maintain fresh and pure water in the bowl), and various types of food, a mobile application and a centralized server for data storage and processing. It is also possible to connect additional modules, such as electronic scales to measure the weight of a pet, a video camera to monitor the pet, as well as control and monitoring of system status. 


In the future, we plan to work with feed manufacturers, for joint production of feed for our feeder. This helps to increase the share of our company in the market.
